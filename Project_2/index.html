       Mirabel is a young girl who may be imperfect and “weird,”but is also empathetic and emotional. She’s determined to prove that she belongs, denying to everyone, including herself, that she feels all alone even in her own house.
       Mirabel's voice actor, describes her: "Mirabel doesn’t have a gift, which I find extremely relatable, because there have been many times in my life where I felt like I didn’t belong, I didn’t measure up, I wasn’t talented enough to be there, I had that sort of imposter syndrome. But I also discovered by getting older, and working more and more on trusting myself, that I do have something to offer, and it is special, and I am myself. So, you know, not everybody’s gonna love that but the people that do, are gonna love it really hard."
       
 Mirabel often shows a free-spirited and optimistic demeanor, despite being the only Madrigal grandchild without a gift, she is still very much sociable and friendly to those around her. Lacking a gift of her own, she would admire her relatives (namely her mother, aunt, cousins, and sisters) and hold them in high regard. She described Isabela as graceful and perfect and Luisa as strong and the brawn of the family. Mirabel represents optimism, originality,confidence and empathy in a world that tends to keep one handicapped for being unique.She also is humble and honest, admitting easily that she and her father are both accident-prone. On top of this, Mirabel appears confident as she claims that she does not need a gift to make herself happy and that she is just as special as everyone else in her family.<a class="link" href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Mirabel_Madrigal#Official_Description"><small>Learn more</small></a>
